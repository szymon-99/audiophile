# E-commerce frontend built with Gatsby

[LIVE DEMO OF THIS SITE](https://audiophile-live.netlify.app/)

Design comes from [frontendmentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) but all of the code and functionallity was created by me.

This is my second project created with [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [strapi](https://strapi.io/).
This site is completely static and fully responsive.

Technologies that i used:
- styled components
- formik
- redux
- formik
- yup
- typescript

To manage store i used redux library for only learning purposes. I know i could achieve same result with Context API.
 
On this site user can add products to cart and then redirect to checkout, where is a form with basic validations. 

This is only a demo site without any backend and working payments build for learning purposes.
